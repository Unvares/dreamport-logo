# Particle System
## What is it?
It is an adjustable particle system component for A-Frame realised via JavaScript Classes.

## How to run it?
To run the project you need a local server with an SSL certificate installed on it.

If you don't know how to install SLL-certificate on local server, choose one of the guides below:

_P.S. Don't create a workspace in VS Code. Open project folder directly. I don't know why but live-server doesn't run with an https protocole through an opened workspace._
