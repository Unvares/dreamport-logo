/* 
    Time Tracker: 1.5 hours

    Minimum Viable Functionality:
    - You can define particle lifetime
    - You can define particle flight direction
    - You can define particle flight speed
    - You can randomise all parameters written above
    - You can define particle texture
    - Particle system is implemented into A-Frame as a component

    Questions to answer:
    - Each ParticleSystem class is for creating and adjusting one particle or bunch of particles?
    - Which methods and variables are intended for incapsulation and which are not? How to incapsulate them?

    Goals for the next week:
    - Implement at least 4 points from the MVF list
